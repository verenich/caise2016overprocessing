OptimizeKnockout v0.1
------------------------

Requirements: R 3.2.0 or above; internet connection to download the datasets and possibly missing packages

What it does:

OptimizeKnockout is a tool for finding an optimal ordering of checks in a knock-out section of process that would minimize the expected processing effort

How:
	OptimizeKnockout implements predictive models and techniques described in the paper 
        "Minimizing Overprocessing Waste in Business Processes via Predictive Activity Ordering" by I. Verenich, M. Dumas, M. La Rosa, F. Maggi and C. Di Francescomarino.

USAGE:
Rscript OptimizeKnockout.R inputData koActivities usefulFeatures disallowed_permutation learner sampling_method n retrain

Example usage:
Rscript OptimizeKnockout.R inputData="Bondora.csv" learner="svm" sampling_method="under" n=3

	Input: 	Event log in the csv format. Only "Bondora.csv" and "Envpermit.csv" have been tested so far  
	Output: Optimal permutation for each ongoing case (+ constant baseline + random), number of checks performed for each case and the minimum possible number of checks

Parameters:
koActivities	list of checks in the knock-out sections. For example, koActivities='c("checkIncome","checkIdentity")'
usefulFeatures	list of features to be used for constructing predicitve models
disallowed_permutation	disallowed combination(s) of checks
learner	classification model for reject probabilities, "rf" for random forest, "tree" for decision tree and "svm" for SVM
sampling_method	sampling of training cases wrt class label to achieve class balance, "under" for undersampling, "none" for none, "over" for oversampling. Default "under"
n	number of random iterations of the whole algorithm (training and test files are regenerated at each run). Default 1
retrain:	logical flag indicating whether to retrain predicitve models. Default TRUE

Note: If using inputData="Bondora.csv" or inputData="Envpermit.csv", all other paramaters are optional 

Common problems:
  If you receive an error "'Rscript' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file",
  please add the path to the executables for R to the system variable "PATH" (on Windows typically 'C:\Program Files (x64)\R\R-3.x.y')
