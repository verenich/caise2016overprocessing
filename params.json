  "body": "\r\nFollowing are supplementary materials for the article \"Minimizing overprocessing waste in business processes via predictive activity ordering\" by Ilya Verenich, Marlon Dumas, Marcello La Rosa, Fabrizio Maggi, and Chiara Di Francescomarino (http://eprints.qut.edu.au/91189)\r\n\r\n**Requirements:**  \r\nR 3.2.0 or above; internet connection to download the datasets and possibly missing packages\r\n\r\n**USAGE:**  \r\n`cd OptimizeKnockout`\r\n`Rscript OptimizeKnockout.R inputData koActivities usefulFeatures disallowed_permutation learner sampling_method n retrain`\r\n\r\n**Example usage:**\r\n`Rscript OptimizeKnockout.R inputData=\"Bondora.csv\" learner=\"svm\" sampling_method=\"under\" n=3`\r\n\r\n**Input: **\r\nEvent log in the csv format. Only \"Bondora.csv\" and \"Envpermit.csv\" have been tested so far\r\n\r\n**Output: **\r\n* n csv files, containing optimal permutation, in the coded form, for each ongoing case according to our suggestion (+ according to the constant probabilities baseline + random), number of checks actually performed for each case and the minimum possible number of checks\r\n* file *_permutations.txt with the possible permutations and their codes\r\n* file *_summary.txt containing total number of checks needed for all test cases, actual total number of performed checks and distribution of the number of checks performed across test cases\r\n\r\n**Parameters:**\r\n* koActivities\tlist of checks in the knock-out sections. For example, koActivities='c(\"checkIncome\",\"checkIdentity\")'\r\n* usefulFeatures\tlist of features to be used for constructing predicitve models\r\n* disallowed_permutation\tdisallowed combination(s) of checks\r\n* learner\tclassification model for reject probabilities, \"rf\" for random forest, \"tree\" for decision tree and \"svm\" for SVM\r\n* sampling_method\tsampling of training cases wrt class label to achieve class balance, \"under\" for undersampling, \"none\" for none, \"over\" for oversampling. Default \"under\"\r\n* n\tnumber of random iterations of the whole algorithm (training and test files are regenerated at each run). Default 1\r\n* retrain:\tlogical flag indicating whether to retrain predicitve models. Default TRUE\r\n\r\nNote: If using inputData=\"Bondora.csv\" or inputData=\"Envpermit.csv\", all other paramaters are optional \r\n\r\n**Common problems:**  \r\n  If you receive an error \"'Rscript' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file\", please add the path to the executables for R to the system variable \"PATH\" (on Windows typically 'C:\\Program Files (x64)\\R\\R-3.x.y')\r\n\r\nNote that this code is a supplementary material and should be modified for the use with other datasets\r\n",
