Only \"Bondora.csv\" and \"Envpermit.csv\" have been tested so far  \r\n\r\n**Output: **\r\n* n csv files, containing optimal permutation, in the coded form, for each ongoing case according to our suggestion (+ according to the constant probabilities baseline + random), number of checks actually performed for each case and the minimum possible number of checks\r\n* file _*_permutations.txt_ with the possible permutations and their codes\r\n* file _*_summary.txt_ containing total number of checks needed for all test cases, actual total number of performed checks and distribution of the number of checks performed across test cases\r\n\r\n**Parameters:**   \r\n* koActivities - list of checks in the knock-out sections. For example, _koActivities='c(\"checkIncome\",\"checkIdentity\")'_\r\n* usefulFeatures - list of features to be used for constructing predicitve models\r\n* disallowed_permutation - disallowed combination(s) of checks\r\n* learner - classification model for reject probabilities, _\"rf\"_ for random forest, _\"tree\"_ for decision tree and _\"svm\"_ for SVM\r\n* sampling_method - sampling of training cases wrt class label to achieve class balance, _\"under\"_ for undersampling, _\"none\"_ for none, _\"over\"_ for oversampling. Default _\"under\"_\r\n* n - number of random iterations of the whole algorithm (training and test files are regenerated at each run). Default 1\r\n* retrain - logical flag indicating whether to retrain predictive models. Default TRUE\r\n\r\n**Note:** If using _inputData=\"Bondora.csv\"_ or _inputData=\"Envpermit.csv\"_, all other paramaters are optional \r\n\r\n**Common problems:**  \r\nIf you receive an error _\"'Rscript' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file\"_, please add the path to the executables for R to the system variable \"PATH\" (on Windows typically _'C:\\Program Files (x64)\\R\\R-3.x.y'_)\r\n\r\nNote that this code is a supplementary material and should be modified for the use with other datasets\r\n",
